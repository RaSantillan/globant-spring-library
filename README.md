# Library Project
## Description
The Library is a web-based application that adheres to a robust MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Built using Java, Spring MVC, Spring Security, and Spring Boot, this architectural framework ensures an efficient and organized approach to managing the library's valuable resources. The utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development enhances the user experience, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This MVC structure allows for a clear separation of concerns, enabling maintainability, scalability, and ease of future development within the application.
